# The-Sparks-Foundation-Task-6
This is task 6 of the Sparks Foundation GRIP in Data Science Domain. You can see in this repository a Jupyter notebook written in Python Language that reads Iris dataset file where the objective is to create decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically. I also added new data to the classifier then trained the model and predict the right class accordingly using test values.
